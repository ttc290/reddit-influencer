# PostgreSQL

1. Populate the `brand_product` table in PostgreSQL by importing the `brand_product.csv` file

2. The resulting tables after ETL process from Spark are: `reddit_users_score` (storing user's aggregated score) and `reddit_users_comment` (storing user's top comment and sentiment analysis)

3. Run `master_table.sql` to create `master_table` by joining the 2 tables.
